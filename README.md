# chessjure

Welcome to Chessjure

Chessjure is a work in progress chess application I've been writing to learn Clojure. 

There are bugs, and the AI is dumb as rocks, but you can run Chessjure and mostly play something resembling a chess.

To run chessjure, you'll need leiningen. 

The command to start the server is

lein figwheel dev

Then open up the following link in your browser:

http://localhost:3447
