# chessjure

Welcome to Chessjure

Chessjure is a work in progress chess application I've been writing to learn Clojure. 

It is written using Clojurescript using the quiescent clojurescript react wrapper library. 

The application currently features move validation and notation parsing. There is still more work to do!

The following still need fixing:

* Check analysis
* Checkmate analysis
* Castling
* A basic AI component might be worthwhile

To run chessjure, you'll need leiningen. 

The command to start the server is

lein figwheel dev

Then open up the following link in your browser:
