# chessjure

Welcome to Chessjure

Chessjure is a work in progress chess application I've been writing to learn Clojure. 

It is written using Clojurescript using the quiescent clojurescript react wrapper library. 

The application currently features move validation and notation parsing. There is still more work to do!

The following still need fixing:

Check analysis
Checkmate analysis
Castling
A basic AI component might be worthwhile.
