# chessjure

Welcome to Chessjure

Chessjure is a work in progress chess application I've been writing to learn Clojure. 

There's currently no AI, but you can run Chessjure and make moves for both sides. Currently Chessjure supports all chess rules except for castling through check.

To run chessjure, you'll need leiningen. 

The command to start the server is

lein figwheel dev

Then open up the following link in your browser:
